Big question: What are the evolutionary origins of glyphosate resistance in Lolium Rigidum in Southeast Australia? What and with how much accuracy can we infer from genetic data alone?
1. [exploratory_analysis](exploratory_analysis.md): Data cleaning, visualization and inference on pooled Lolium Rigidum polymorphism data in Southeast Australia
2. [smooth_spline_fitting](spline_fitting.md)
