What are the evolutionary origins of glyphosate resistance in *Lolium rigidum* in Southeast Australia? What can we infer from genetic data alone? (and with how much accuracy?)

Exploratory analysis python and rust code in `src/`

The data consists of 246 sequenced and phenotyped *Lolium rigidum* pools from across Southeast Australia. Glyphosate resistance is measured as the proportion of a tested sample still remaining after treatment.
