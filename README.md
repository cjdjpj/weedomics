What are the evolutionary origins of glyphosate resistance in *Lolium rigidum* in Southeast Australia? What can we infer from genetic data alone? (and with how much accuracy?)
1. [exploratory_analysis](exploratory_analysis.md): Inference of pooled *Lolium rigidum* polymorphism data in Southeast Australia. Detection of characteristics of glyphosate resistance selection at the genomic level.
2. [gudmc_validation.md](gudmc_validation.md): Validation of gudmc (Genomewide Unbiased Discernment of Modes of Convergent evolution) using quantiNemo2 forward simulations

Exploratory analysis python and rust code in `src/`

The data consists of 246 sequenced and phenotyped *Lolium rigidum* pools from across Southeast Australia. Glyphosate resistance is measured as the proportion of a tested sample still remaining after treatment.
